# Iris Flower Classification

## Overview
This project uses the Iris flower dataset to train a Logistic Regression model that classifies iris flowers into one of three categories:

1. Setosa  
2. Versicolour  
3. Virginica  

The classification is based on four features:  

1. Sepal Length  
2. Sepal Width  
3. Petal Length  
4. Petal Width  

The dataset has 150 samples evenly divided among the three flower types.

## Goals  
- Train a Logistic Regression model.  
- Check the accuracy of the model.  
- Predict flower types from the test data.

---

## Requirements  
You need Python 3.x and these libraries:  
- `scikit-learn`  
- `numpy`  
- `pandas`  
---

## Results  
- **Accuracy**: The accuracy of the model is calculated as a percentage.  
- **Predictions**: Predicted categories of test samples are printed for review.  

---

## Summary  
This project shows how to classify flowers with basic features. The model performs well with high accuracy.
